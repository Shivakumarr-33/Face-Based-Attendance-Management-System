# Face-Based-Attendance-Management-System
This project implements a Face-Based Attendance Management System using Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, and MySQL. The system allows for real-time facial recognition to mark attendance, providing a secure and automated solution for tracking attendance.

Features
Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV with the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm to recognize and identify faces in real-time.
User Registration: Allows users to register by providing their details and capturing their facial images.
Automated Attendance Marking: Automatically marks attendance when a recognized face is detected.
Tkinter GUI: User-friendly interface for managing user registration, capturing images, and viewing attendance records.
MySQL Integration: Stores user details and attendance records in a MySQL database for reliable data management and reporting.
